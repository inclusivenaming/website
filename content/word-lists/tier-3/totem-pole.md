# Term: totem pole

## Definition/Use Context 
Often used in phrases such as *bottom of the totem pole* or *low man on the totem pole* to imply that someone or something is inferior. 

## Recommendation
Replace when possible.

## Recommended replacements
- hierarchy
- rank

## Unsuitable Replacements 
None

## Rationale
A totem pole is a sacred object in Indigenous communities, and the bottom of the totem pole has a specific symbolic meaning. Ddescribing someone or something as *bottom* or *low man*, to imply that they are inferior, dishonors the symbolic meaning and is inaccurate besides.
