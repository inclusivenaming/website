Terms in this list should be replaced whenever possible, barring major breaking changes.
Terms included in this list have one or all of the following:

- Terms which would otherwise be in Tier 1 but have dependencies on language set by standards bodies, or are deeply embedded in low-level systems and thus difficult to change
