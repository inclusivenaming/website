    From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing):

    > White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing).

rationale: |
    White box refers to transparency, i.e., internal details are visible to the tester. This term is not based on a good/bad binary where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad and so does not promote racial bias.
