definition: "N/A"
use_context: "Used metaphorically to represent a dependent relationship, such as between a superior and dependent node."
recommendation: "No change recommended. Although the relationship of parent and child is one of dependency, it is appropriate. Parents do have legal rights over children until a certain age, so it is a natural dependency relationship. Children falling victim to adult power is neither the main nor the intended result of this relationship, so this term does not typically represent an abuse of power."
