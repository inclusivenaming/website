title: "Language evaluation principles and framework"

# Overview 

The language evaluation framework is a guidance document developed by the Kubernetes Naming Working Group . The version of this documentation found on the Inclusive Naming website is a mirror.

It outlines a structured framework for evaluating language and terminology for harm to the community. This enables the community to navigate divisive conversations with a measure of clarity.

The framework was originally created for an open source technology project and was subsequently revised by the INI to apply to other technology-related contexts as well.

See also the 
[implementation path document](/language/implementation-path) for a discussion of how changes in different portions of your project have different levels of impact on your users.

## How to use this document

The framework is divided into three sections: first-, second-, and third-order concerns, ranked in order of potential harm to the community.

- First-order concerns are language where harm is egregious, overt, and clearly problematic. 
- Second-order concerns are language which is problematic but with a less definite impact. 
- Third-order concerns indicate language that could use improvement but does no demonstrable harm.

Answer all questions for each term evaluated.

When complete, consider questions answered in the affirmative: in general, the more questions answered “yes” or “possibly”, the more likely it is that the language in question needs to be replaced.

If any first-order concerns are a “yes”, replace the language.

If a significant number of second- or third- order concerns are a “yes”, strongly consider replacing the language.

This framework is intentionally non-prescriptive. The intention in this work is to reduce harm for the community; let harm reduction guide your decisions.

# First-order-concerns

- The term perpetuates bias or stereotypes in a manner that is harmful to any historically underrepresented group of people.
- The term is overtly disparaging towards any historically underrepresented group of people. 
- The term is loaded, problematic or politically charged outside of technology contexts, even if the language is itself etymologically neutral.

## Questions to ask

- Does the term refer to a group of people in contexts outside of technology? If so, are these 
- Is the term potentially disparaging in other contexts? 
- In discussion of the term, are opinions strongly split, even if the term isn’t directly harmful?


# Second-order concerns

- The term is unnecessarily violent, oppressive, or elitist terms.
- The term originates from a history of injustice, oppression, or identity-based discrimination except when referring to the actual historical events.
- The term is culturally appropriated
- The term is associated with identity or status of a historically underrepresented group in a way that is negative or judgmental.
- The term is unnecessarily gendered.

## Questions to ask

- Does the term have militaristic connotations? 
- Does the term or phrase have historical use either inside or outside technology contexts that someone can easily identity? - Did it arise during a world war, for example?
- Is the term classist or otherwise segregational? 
- Is the term strongly associated with one gender?

# Third-order concerns 

- The term is unclear, uses metaphor, or a more precise word is available.
- The term anthropomorphizes (ascribes human traits to nonhuman objects) code or computer systems
- The language is idomatic, and understanding is limited to those in a particular culture or in-group

## Questions to ask

- Does the term use metaphor, simile or other literary devices to communicate a point?
- Is understanding the term conditional on belonging to a specific culture or in-group? 
- Does the term assign human-like qualities to technological systems?
