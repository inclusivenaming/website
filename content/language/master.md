In computing, A "master"often refers to the original or main version of an entity.

* main 
* original 
* source
* control plane

**Reasoning:** 

While master in and of itself is potentially neutral, the propensity in which it is associated with the term slave in computing makes master on its own guilty by association. Though it is used as a standalone, it's impossible to remove the association with command and control entirely, and thus we recommend moving away from even singular use.

**Recommendation:** Adopt immediately.
