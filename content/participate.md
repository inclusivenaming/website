## Get your company involved 

We are currently looking for representatives from different organizations to work on this initiative collaboratively. The best way to join as a company is to **Join the mailing list:** [inclusivenaming@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/g/inclusivenaming), and identify yourself and your company. 

[Project leadership](/leadership) will then work with you to identify who in your company needs to be involved and what your best contributions can be!

## View the project board and file issues

The [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/inclusivenaming/projects/1) is where we track the work being done for the Inclusive naming initiative. You can also file issues for work you'd like to see or open questions you have via the [inclusivenaming/org repository](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/org/issues).

## Make changes in your projects

Use the resources we've compiled so far – the [Word replacement list](/word-lists/overview), [Implementation path](/language/implementation-path), and the [Language evaluation framework](/language/evaluation-framework) and start making changes in your own projects! This is the most impactful way to get involved and our goal as an initiative.

## Approach other projects

Outreach to other projects, to encourage them to change their language, needs to be handled carefully, patiently, and
compassionately. We've collected some [tips on approaching projects](/outreach) to increase your chances of success.
