We're lucky to be working with some of the most innovative and caring organizations on the planet for this initiative. Here's a list of the initiatives our participants are working on!

## By IBM and Red Hat 

{{< button "https://github.com/conscious-lang/conscious-lang-docs" "Conscious language in your open source projects" >}}

A list of alternative terms in technology published by the IETF standards group for use on an ongoing basis. We also recommend reading the [Terminology, Power and Oppressive Language](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-knodel-terminology) draft document for more research and background.

## By Kubernetes

The Kubernetes naming working group is tacking many of the issues addressed by the Inclusive Language Initiative on a smaller, more tactical scale. Viewing the working group's documents and process could prove useful for projects and companies trying to make similar changes. We also recommend joining their [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-wg-naming).

The LF Networking nonprofit started this working group to tackle language and inclusive naming issues in the networking space. The group meets twice a month currently. We also recommend joining their [mailing list](https://lists.lfnetworking.org/g/inclusive-lang-wg).
