The Inclusive Naming Initiativeâ€™s mission is to promote and facilitate replacing harmful and exclusionary language in information technology


## Activities, Goals, and Deliverables

We're looking to bring together a community of information technology organizations and professionals to collaboratively:

* Define **processes** for removing harmful and exclusionary language from software, APIs, standards, and other IT-related materials
* Develop **resources and tools** such as a comprehensive list of harmful terms and suggested replacements, language evaluation frameworks, templates, and guidance and best practice materials
* Recommend **implementation paths** for different use cases
* Provide **tooling** to measure implementation success
* Act as a platform for **community recognition** of organizations actively doing the work

## Roadmap 

Note: Roadmap is subject to change

* **Q1 2021**
  * Define best practices and replacements with the community, providing documents and tools for participants to get started
  * Discuss at KubeCon community meeting

* **Q3 2021**
  * Showcase case studies and success stories
  * Share wins at KubeCon 2021

* **Q4 2021** (based on demand)
  * Develop certification program
