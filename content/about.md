title: "About the Inclusive Naming Initiative"
---

The Inclusive Naming Initiative’s mission is to help companies and projects remove all harmful and unclear language of any kind and replace it with an agreed-upon set of neutral terms. The initiative’s goal is to define processes and tools to remove harmful language from projects. This includes creating a comprehensive list of terms with replacements, language evaluation frameworks and templates, and infrastructure to aid the transition. RedHat, IBM, LF Networking, and the Kubernetes Naming WG are all already on board.


## Goals

We're looking to:

* Provide a consistent set of **language recommendations** in projects
* Recommend **implementation paths** for different use cases
* Provide **tooling** to measure implementation success
* Act as a platform for **community recognition** of organizations actively doing the work

## Roadmap 

Note: Roadmap is subject to change

* **Q1 2021**
  * Define best practices and replacements with the community, providing documents and tools for folx to get started
  * Discuss at KubeCon community meeting

* **Q3 2021**
  * Showcase case studies and success stories
  * Share wins at KubeCon 2021
